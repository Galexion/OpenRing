<h1 class="chivo-mono-header" style="padding-left:5vw;">&gt;&gt;&gt;  Rules</h1>
<h3 class="chivo-mono-sub"  style="padding-left:2.5vw;margin-top:-1vh;">Because Regulations.</h3>

<ol>
    <li>100% Metal and Wires.</li>
    Sorry Protogens and Cyborgs, but we are looking for 100% Metal, not a mix of Flesh and Metal.
    <li>No Human Look-alikes Either.</li>
    Androids like the <a href="/">Cyberlife Series</a> seem to operate more like humans. not that we have any problems with that, but theming is everything.
    <li>Content must be [OK] for all users.</li>
    Please keep any and all NSFW / NSFL off the site.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you link to that type of content, please remove it from the starting page and gate any content with a warning.
    <br>
    <br>
    This does <b><i>NOT</i></b> mean that a user can come up to Admin and ask for someone to change something.
    <li>No AI-Generated / Based on 202X Content.</li>
    <i>*checks the reality checkmark*</i> This rule seems redundant, but LLM's don't count as Robots. Please come back when you have AGI's with sentience that are wanting to sign up. also, we don't need more enshittification, les we forget about `willy's chocolate experience`.
    <br><br>
    We are also banning the themes of Cryptocurrency's and Web3 in general.
    <br><br>
    <b>Note:</b> this does not effect pages that accept Crypto as a payment method for a item or as a donation, though Crypto must not be your only payment method if you have a shop linked to your page.
